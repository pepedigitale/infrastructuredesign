"""
Turns (nodesDf, edgesDf, routes, your headway dict) into headway arcs on the
EAN built by build_ean.py.

Pipeline
--------
1. build_infra_graph      : nodesDf/edgesDf -> undirected infra graph
2. extract_chains         : split graph at degree>=3 (junctions) and
                             degree==1 (line ends) nodes into 1-D chains,
                             matching your own "rank>=3" segmentation
3. train_direction        : 'up'/'down' from pk_rel monotonicity along a
                             train's route
4. train_speed_category   : 'fast'/'slow' heuristic from stop pattern vs.
                             nodesDf.stop_fast / stop_slow -- FLAGGED, verify
5. chain_boundary_event    : maps a chain's physical boundary node to the
                             nearest real EAN event in a train's route
6. assemble_headway_constraints : for every chain, order the trains that use
                             it by scheduled entry time, and emit one
                             headway constraint per consecutive pair, using
                             the correct (cat_i, cat_j) entry from your
                             16-value-per-chain dict
7. add_headway_arcs (from build_ean.py) attaches them to G

ASSUMPTIONS TO VERIFY BEFORE TRUSTING THE OUTPUT
-------------------------------------------------
- UP_IS_INCREASING_PK : whether increasing pk_rel along a route means 'up'
  or 'down' in your headway-dict labels. Check one train you know the
  direction of and flip the flag below if needed.
- train_speed_category(): heuristic only. Spot-check a couple of known
  fast/slow trains before trusting the classification for all of them.
