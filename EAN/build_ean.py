"""
Event-Activity Network (EAN) construction for a single-track railway line.

Design
------
Nodes  = timetable events: (train_id, station, 'arr'|'dep', seq_index)
Edges  = activities with a MINIMUM DURATION attribute `min_duration` (seconds):
    - "running"        : departure(station i) -> arrival(station i+1)
    - "dwell"          : arrival(station i)    -> departure(station i)
    - "schedule_floor" : SOURCE -> first departure of a train
                          (encodes "a train may not depart before the plan")
    - "headway"        : event of train i -> corresponding event of train j
                          on a shared resource (block/loop/platform), added
                          separately once you supply your computed headways

No dispatching / no reordering is assumed: train order at every shared
resource is fixed a priori (normally: scheduled order), so headway arcs are
directed from the earlier train's event to the later train's event and the
graph stays a DAG. Realized time of any event = max over all incoming arcs
of (realized_time(tail) + min_duration(arc)), evaluated in topological
order -> this is the propagation step used later for both the deterministic
sanity check below and, eventually, for each Monte Carlo draw.
